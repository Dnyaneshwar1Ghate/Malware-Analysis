Dynamic malware analysis uses a sandbox, which is a secure, isolated, 
virtual environment where you can run suspected dangerous code. 
Security professionals can closely monitor the malware in the sandbox without 
worrying about infecting the rest of the system or network, 
allowing them to gather more information about the malware.
